FOR COURSE STAFF
-----

  - Please contact Niksula Guru (http://www.niksula.hut.fi/staff) to transfer the ownership of course Git group (the group, not individual repositories) to you.
    If the previous course staff is still reachable you may also ask them to do the transfer.
  - Assume Master access of `opastus` repository (this repository).
  - Review and update materials in this repository.
    Re-create the reference header `p2pn/p2p.h` if necessary.
    Check TODOs in individual documents.
  - Update `groups.csv` according to the sign up list of this year.
  - Create repositories for this year's students.
  - P2P: Request virtual machines for bootstrap servers from guru@cs.hut.fi
    See http://rtfm.cs.hut.fi/virtual-machines (Intranet web site).
    Note that there are two IT systems in the CSE department, **cs.hut** for *work* and **Niksula** for *students*.
    Once you signed the work contract for course assistant, you became an employee of the department.
    Check if you have an account for *work*: http://rtfm.cs.hut.fi/unix-guide .
    Plan the firewall access requirements carefully.
    P2P service ports need to be globally accessible.
  - Verify assignment instructions and sample implementations.
  - If you took the course before, verify also your previous experiences and solutions.
  - Time reservation sheet, for example for demo(s), can be made with Foodle (https://foodl.org/).
